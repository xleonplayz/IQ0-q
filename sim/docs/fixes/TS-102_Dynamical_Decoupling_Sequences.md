# TS-102: Dynamical Decoupling Sequences Implementation

## Summary
Implement quantum-accurate dynamical decoupling pulse sequences for NV center spin manipulation, including XY8, CPMG, and customizable sequences using the SimOS backend. These sequences are essential for extending coherence time and performing quantum sensing experiments.

## Motivation
Dynamical decoupling techniques are critical for practical quantum sensing applications with NV centers as they extend coherence times by decoupling the NV spin from its noisy environment. Currently, the simulator only has a simplified XY8 sequence implementation, which lacks the full quantum-mechanical accuracy and customizability needed for realistic simulations.

## Description
This technical story focuses on enhancing the simulator with comprehensive, quantum-accurate dynamical decoupling capabilities that accurately model realistic pulse sequences, finite pulse durations, and decoherence effects.

### Requirements
1. Implement full quantum mechanical simulations of standard DD sequences:
   - Hahn Echo
   - CPMG-n
   - XY4, XY8, XY16
   - KDD (Knill Dynamical Decoupling)
   - Concatenated DD sequences

2. Enable realistic pulse modeling:
   - Finite pulse width effects
   - Pulse shape effects (square, Gaussian, GRAPE-optimized)
   - Phase and amplitude errors
   - Frequency detuning effects

3. Provide high-level API for sequence creation and customization
4. Enable accurate modeling of decoherence during sequences
5. Provide analysis tools for sequence fidelity and error metrics

### Implementation Details
1. Create a dedicated module for DD sequences:
   ```
   src/
     sequences/
       __init__.py
       base_sequence.py
       standard_sequences.py
       pulse_shapes.py
       sequence_analyzer.py
   ```

2. Implement the base sequence class that integrates with SimOS:
   ```python
   class DynamicalDecouplingSequence:
       def __init__(self, nv_system, pulse_params=None):
           self._nv_system = nv_system
           self._pulse_params = pulse_params or {}
           self._sequence = []
           
       def add_pulse(self, axis, angle, duration, shape='square'):
           # Add a pulse to the sequence
           self._sequence.append({
               'axis': axis,        # 'x', 'y', or 'z'
               'angle': angle,      # rotation angle in radians
               'duration': duration, # pulse duration in s
               'shape': shape       # pulse shape
           })
           
       def add_delay(self, duration):
           # Add a delay (free evolution) to the sequence
           self._sequence.append({
               'axis': None,
               'duration': duration
           })
           
       def simulate(self, initial_state=None, magnetic_field=None, 
                    include_decoherence=True):
           # Use SimOS to simulate the sequence including decoherence
           # Return the final state and measurement statistics
   ```

3. Implement standard sequence generators:
   ```python
   def create_hahn_echo(nv_system, tau, pulse_duration=50e-9):
       """
       Create a Hahn Echo sequence (π/2 - τ - π - τ - π/2)
       
       Parameters:
       -----------
       nv_system : NVSystem
           The NV system to simulate
       tau : float
           Delay time between pulses in seconds
       pulse_duration : float
           Duration of π pulses in seconds
       """
       seq = DynamicalDecouplingSequence(nv_system)
       seq.add_pulse('x', np.pi/2, pulse_duration, 'square')
       seq.add_delay(tau)
       seq.add_pulse('x', np.pi, pulse_duration, 'square')
       seq.add_delay(tau)
       seq.add_pulse('x', np.pi/2, pulse_duration, 'square')
       return seq
   
   def create_xy8(nv_system, tau, pulse_duration=50e-9, repetitions=1):
       """
       Create an XY8 sequence with specified repetitions
       """
       seq = DynamicalDecouplingSequence(nv_system)
       # Initial π/2 pulse
       seq.add_pulse('x', np.pi/2, pulse_duration, 'square')
       
       # XY8 core sequence
       for _ in range(repetitions):
           # XY8 sequence: τ-X-τ-Y-τ-X-τ-Y-τ-Y-τ-X-τ-Y-τ-X
           for pulse_axis in ['x', 'y', 'x', 'y', 'y', 'x', 'y', 'x']:
               seq.add_delay(tau)
               seq.add_pulse(pulse_axis, np.pi, pulse_duration, 'square')
       
       # Final delay and π/2 pulse
       seq.add_delay(tau)
       seq.add_pulse('x', np.pi/2, pulse_duration, 'square')
       
       return seq
   ```

4. Integrate SimOS for quantum-accurate evolution:
   ```python
   def evolve_sequence(self, sequence, initial_state, hamiltonian, collapse_ops=None):
       """
       Evolve the quantum state through a pulse sequence using SimOS
       """
       # Initialize with the given state
       state = initial_state.copy()
       
       # Apply each element in the sequence
       for element in sequence:
           if element['axis'] is None:
               # Free evolution under the Hamiltonian
               propagator = simos.propagation.evol(hamiltonian, element['duration'])
               if collapse_ops:
                   # Use master equation for decoherence
                   # ... (master equation solver code) ...
               else:
                   # Pure unitary evolution
                   state = propagator * state * propagator.dag()
           else:
               # Apply pulse with appropriate axis and shape
               pulse_hamiltonian = self._create_pulse_hamiltonian(element)
               # ... (pulse evolution code) ...
       
       return state
   ```

5. Implement analysis tools for sequence performance:
   ```python
   def analyze_sequence_fidelity(sequence, target_state, noise_model=None):
       """
       Analyze the fidelity of a sequence under different noise conditions
       """
       # ... (fidelity calculation code) ...
   ```

### API Integration
The new sequence capabilities will be exposed through the existing PhysicalNVModel class:

```python
class PhysicalNVModel:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    def simulate_dd_sequence(self, sequence_type, tau, repetitions=1, 
                             pulse_duration=50e-9, analysis=True):
        """
        Simulate a dynamical decoupling sequence
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        sequence_type : str
            Type of sequence ('hahn', 'cpmg', 'xy4', 'xy8', 'xy16', 'kdd')
        tau : float
            Delay time between pulses in seconds
        repetitions : int
            Number of repetitions of the base sequence

            Whether to perform sequence analysis
            
        Returns:
        --------
        SimulationResult
            Results of sequence simulation including coherence information
        """
        # Create appropriate sequence
        if sequence_type == 'hahn':
            sequence = create_hahn_echo(self._nv_system, tau, pulse_duration)
        elif sequence_type == 'xy8':
            sequence = create_xy8(self._nv_system, tau, pulse_duration, repetitions)
        # ... other sequence types ...
        
        # Initialize state
        initial_state = self._state.copy()
        
        # Evolve through sequence
        final_state = sequence.simulate(
            initial_state, 
            magnetic_field=self._magnetic_field,
            include_decoherence=True
        )
        
        # Return results
        return SimulationResult(
            type="DD",
            sequence_type=sequence_type,
            tau=tau,
            repetitions=repetitions,
            initial_state=initial_state,
            final_state=final_state,
            coherence=self._calculate_coherence(initial_state, final_state)
        )
```

### Testing Strategy
1. Verify the implemented sequences against analytical solutions for simple cases
2. Compare simulated decoherence curves with experimental measurements
3. Test the effect of pulse errors on sequence performance
4. Benchmark against literature results for standard sequence performance

## Technical Risks
1. Computational complexity when simulating long sequences or many repetitions
2. Numerical stability in simulations with small time steps
3. Accuracy degradation in modeling realistic pulse shapes
4. Memory usage for large Hilbert spaces
