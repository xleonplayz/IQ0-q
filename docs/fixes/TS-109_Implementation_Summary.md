# TS-109: Simulator Quality Assessment Implementation

## Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of TS-109, focused on conducting a comprehensive quality assessment of the NV simulator and implementing critical improvements to address identified issues.

## Assessment Results

The quality assessment revealed several areas requiring improvement:

1. **Physical Correctness**: Several approximations were used without proper validation, including:
   - Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) without validity checks
   - Temperature parameters not affecting relaxation rates
   - Simplified strain effects and excited state structure

2. **Mock Implementations**: Several critical components used placeholder implementations:
   - RF Hamiltonian construction for nuclear spin control
   - DEER sequence implementation using analytical formulas instead of quantum evolution
   - Dynamic Nuclear Polarization using empirical formulas
   - Partial implementation of Cluster Correlation Expansion (CCE)

3. **Thread Safety**: Inconsistent locking practices and lack of proper thread-safe patterns.

4. **Performance**: Limited scaling for complex quantum systems due to:
   - Fixed time stepping regardless of dynamics complexity
   - Inefficient handling of large nuclear spin baths
   - Poor memory management for large simulations

5. **Documentation**: Limited documentation of physical principles, approximations, and extension points.
