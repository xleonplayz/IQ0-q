## Implementation Order and Dependencies

The recommended implementation order follows the story numbering:

1. **TS-101: QDI Hardware Interface** - Fundamental integration with Qudi
2. **TS-102: Dynamical Decoupling Sequences** - Enhanced experiment capabilities
3. **TS-103: Nuclear Spin Environment** - Realistic NV center environment
4. **TS-104: Qudi Experiment Modes** - Complete Qudi integration 
5. **TS-105: Performance Optimization** - Scale to complex simulations
6. **TS-106: Confocal Microscopy Simulation** - Spatial scanning capabilities
7. **TS-107: Qudi Module Integration** ✅ - Complete implementation of all Qudi hardware interfaces

Some stories have dependencies:
- TS-106 depends on TS-101 for Qudi hardware interfaces
- TS-104 builds on the foundation of TS-101
- TS-105 should be implemented after other core features are complete
- TS-107 depends on TS-101 and TS-106 for Qudi hardware interfaces and confocal capabilities

## Current Status

The simulator already has:
- Basic NV center quantum model using SimOS backend
- ODMR and Rabi experiment simulation
- Simplistic pulse sequence handling
- Initial thread safety and error handling

## Design Principles

All technical stories follow these design principles:

1. **SimOS Integration**: Leverage SimOS for quantum mechanical accuracy
2. **Qudi Compatibility**: Implement interfaces required by Qudi modules
3. **Extensibility**: Design with future extensions in mind
4. **Performance**: Balance between quantum accuracy and usability
5. **User Experience**: Provide intuitive APIs for simulator configuration

## Testing Strategy

Each technical story includes specific testing requirements, but the general testing approach involves:

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for simulator with Qudi
3. Validation against theoretical models or experimental data
4. Performance and scalability tests

## Total Implementation Effort

The complete enhancement of the NV center simulator requires approximately **84.5 person-days** based on the estimates from all technical stories. This includes development, testing, and integration of all components.
