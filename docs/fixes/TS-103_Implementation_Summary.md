## Model Initialization Example
```python
# Create model with nuclear spin environment
model = PhysicalNVModel(
    nuclear_spins=True,
    c13_concentration=0.011,  # Natural abundance
    bath_size=15,             # Number of nuclear spins to include
    include_nitrogen_nuclear=True,
    nitrogen_species="14N"
)

# Apply magnetic field
model.set_magnetic_field([0, 0, 0.05])  # 500 G along z-axis

# Calculate coherence times
coherence_times = model.calculate_coherence_times()
print(f"T2*: {coherence_times['t2_star']*1e6:.2f} μs")
print(f"T2:  {coherence_times['t2']*1e6:.2f} μs")
```
