.. _Constants:

Physical Constants
------------------

SimOS provides a series of physical constants that are commonly required in spin dynamics 
simulations.

.. _GyroRatios:

Gyromagnetic Ratios
-------------------

We offer a complete list of gyromagnetic ratios (any nucleus that is reasonably stable is included). Our list
can also be accessed on a separate `webpage  <https://www.kherb.io/docs/nmr_table.html>`_. 

Trivial Conversion Functions
----------------------------

SimOS further provides a series of trivial conversion functions that can help in making your code more readable.
