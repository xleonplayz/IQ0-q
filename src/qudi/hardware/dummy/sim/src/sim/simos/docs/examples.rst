Examples
========

SimOS comes with a series of example Jupyter notebooks that provide a hands-on introduction to the syntax of the library and spin dynamics simulations in general. These notebooks can be found in a `separate repository <http://github.com/spinsimulation/simos_examples>`_.  The examples cover a wide range of topics, from the basics of the library to more advanced simulations of spin dynamics in complex systems. To get started, you can view the examples online by following the links below. Please take also a look at our :ref:`tutorial <Tutorial>`. 

In addition to viewing the examples online, you can also run them interactively in your browser using the `Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/spinsimulation/simos_examples/master>`_ service or our `Virtual Lab <https://simos.kherb.io/virtual/lab/index.html?path=Welcome.ipynb>`_. 

General introductory examples
-----------------------------
The following examples are recommended for beginners who are new to SimOS or spin dynamics simulations in general:

- `Basic NMR examples (symbolic calculations) <https://github.com/spinsimulation/simos_examples/blob/master/Basic_NMR_experiments_symbolic.ipynb>`_
- `Introduction to the Fokker-Planck module <https://github.com/spinsimulation/simos_examples/blob/master/Basic_Two_Spin_Fokker_Planck.ipynb>`_

Examples for Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers
------------------------------------------
The following examples cover the simulation of spin dynamics in NV centers, which are a popular platform for quantum sensing and quantum information processing:

- `NV center photo physics <https://github.com/spinsimulation/simos_examples/blob/master/NV_photophysics.ipynb>`_
- `Weak-measurement based NV-NMR <https://github.com/spinsimulation/simos_examples/blob/master/NV_weak_measurements.ipynb>`_

Examples for Spin-Correlated Radical Pairs (SCRPs)
--------------------------------------------------
The following examples cover the simulation of spin dynamics in SCRPs:

- `Symbolic calculations for SCRPs <https://github.com/spinsimulation/simos_examples/blob/master/SCRP_basics.ipynb>`_
